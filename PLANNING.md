We are in the process creating a Javascript webapp using React to test distance visual acuity. This is going to be used in a hospital setting to allow us to set up a computer at any distance (within reason) from a patient, calibrate screen size/resolution and distance from patient to get accurate letter heights for a specified font, and then display lines of letters of varying sizes to get a good distance acuity. The goal of this is to ultimately enable the ophthalmologist on call to be able to measure more accurate distance acuities anywhere in the hospital where we can roll a computer into a room.
